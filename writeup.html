    <p>Apple’s website is a strong example of effective user interface design based on the four principles discussed in
        Chapter 12: consistency, ease of navigation, universal usability, and error prevention.</p>

    <p>The site demonstrates consistency through its repeated layout, color scheme, typography, and navigation across
        all pages. Product sections follow the same structure, making the site predictable and easy to understand. This
        consistency helps users quickly find information without relearning the interface.</p>

    <p>In terms of ease of navigation, Apple uses a simple and clearly labeled top navigation bar that remains
        consistent throughout the site. Important pages are accessible within a few clicks, and large clickable areas
        make navigation effective on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Apple’s website also supports universal usability. The design is responsive, readable, and visually clear, with
        good contrast between text and background. The layout adapts well to different screen sizes, although additional
        accessibility controls such as text resizing options could improve usability further.</p>

    <p>Finally, error prevention is supported through clear user flows and limited, guided actions, especially during
        purchasing or form interactions. Overall, Apple’s website effectively applies the design principles from Chapter
        12 while maintaining a clean and user-friendly experience.</p>
