            <h3>Good Web App Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com">https://www.apple.com</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apple’s website is a strong example of effective user interface design based on the 
                            four principles discussed in Chapter 12: consistency, ease of navigation, universal 
                            usability, and error prevention.</li>

                        <li>The site demonstrates consistency through its repeated layout, color scheme, typography, and navigation acrossall pages.
                            Product sections follow the same structure, making the site predictable and easy to understand. 
                            This consistency helps users quickly find information without relearning the interface.</li>
                        <li>In terms of ease of navigation, Apple uses a simple and clearly labeled top navigation bar that remainsconsistent throughout the site. 
                            Important pages are accessible within a few clicks, and large clickable area make navigation effective on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
                        <li>Apple’s website also supports universal usability. The design is responsive, readable, and visually clear, withgood contrast between text and background. 
                            The layout adapts well to different screen sizes, although additional accessibility controls such as text resizing options could improve usability further.</li>
                        <li>Finally, error prevention is supported through clear user flows and limited, guided actions, especially during purchasing or form interactions. 
                            Overall, Apple’s website effectively applies the design principles from Chapter 12 while maintaining a clean and user-friendly experience.</li>

            <h3>Poor Web Design Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.arngren.net/">https://www.arngren.net/</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The website has no unified visual standards whatsoever. Fonts, colors, button styles and page layouts vary drastically across different pages. 
                            For instance, the homepage navigation is made up of cluttered text links, but the navigation bar’s position and style change completely when entering product category pages. 
                            Product cards also have no consistent size, borders or shadow effects; more than 5 font styles and 8 colors are used on a single page, making the information hierarchy totally vagueUsers cannot build a stable cognitive model of the website. 
                            Every click feels like using a brand-new site, which brings extremely high cognitive load and easily leads to user fatigue and confusion.</li>
                        <li>The site has no fixed navigation bar, only piling over 30 uncategorized text links at the top, with no search function available. To find a specific electronic product like a camera, users have to browse pages one by one, usually needing more than 5 clicks. 
                            There is no breadcrumb navigation either, so users cannot trace back quickly once they enter deep-level product pages. On mobile devices, the text is too tiny to click accurately, making the website completely unusable on phones.</li>
                        <li>All images on the website lack alt text descriptions, so screen readers cannot recognize and explain the image content for visually impaired users. The contrast between text and background is far below the WCAG 2.1 AA standard — light gray text is used on light gray background, 
                            which is hard to read for users with low vision. In addition, the site does not support keyboard navigation; pressing the Tab key cannot focus on key buttons like "Add to Cart", so users with mobility impairments cannot finish the ordering process.</li>
                        <li>The website has a lot of broken links; clicking some product links will directly lead to 404 error pages. There is no success prompt after adding items to the cart, so users cannot confirm if their operation works. 
                            Form validation is only done after submission, and all filled-in content will be cleared once an error is found, forcing users to re-enter all information. Besides, there is no pre-check for product stock before ordering; users are only informed of out-of-stock items after they complete the payment.</li>
                    </ul> 
                </li>
            </ul>
