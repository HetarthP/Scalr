    <p>Apple’s website is a strong example of effective user interface design based on the four principles discussed in
        Chapter 12: consistency, ease of navigation, universal usability, and error prevention.</p>

    <p>The site demonstrates consistency through its repeated layout, color scheme, typography, and navigation across
        all pages. Product sections follow the same structure, making the site predictable and easy to understand. This
        consistency helps users quickly find information without relearning the interface.</p>

    <p>In terms of ease of navigation, Apple uses a simple and clearly labeled top navigation bar that remains
        consistent throughout the site. Important pages are accessible within a few clicks, and large clickable areas
        make navigation effective on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Apple’s website also supports universal usability. The design is responsive, readable, and visually clear, with
        good contrast between text and background. The layout adapts well to different screen sizes, although additional
        accessibility controls such as text resizing options could improve usability further.</p>

    <p>Finally, error prevention is supported through clear user flows and limited, guided actions, especially during
        purchasing or form interactions. Overall, Apple’s website effectively applies the design principles from Chapter
        12 while maintaining a clean and user-friendly experience.</p>

    <h1>Poor Web Design Analysis</h1>
    <p><strong>Analyzed Website:</strong> Arngren.net</p>
    <p><strong>Website URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.arngren.net/">https://www.arngren.net/</a></p>

    <h3>1. Violation of the Consistency Principle</h3>
    <p><strong>Specific Performance:</strong> The website has no unified visual standards whatsoever. Fonts, colors,
        button styles and page layouts vary drastically across different pages. For instance, the homepage navigation is
        made up of cluttered text links, but the navigation bar’s position and style change completely when entering
        product category pages. Product cards also have no consistent size, borders or shadow effects; more than 5 font
        styles and 8 colors are used on a single page, making the information hierarchy totally vague.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> Users cannot build a stable cognitive model of the website. Every click feels
        like using a brand-new site, which brings extremely high cognitive load and easily leads to user fatigue and
        confusion.</p>

    <h3>2. Violation of the Ease of Navigation Principle</h3>
    <p><strong>Specific Performance:</strong> The site has no fixed navigation bar, only piling over 30 uncategorized
        text links at the top, with no search function available. To find a specific electronic product like a camera,
        users have to browse pages one by one, usually needing more than 5 clicks. There is no breadcrumb navigation
        either, so users cannot trace back quickly once they enter deep-level product pages. On mobile devices, the text
        is too tiny to click accurately, making the website completely unusable on phones.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> The cost for users to search for information is extremely high, and they cannot
        find target content within 3 clicks as required. Most users will leave the site directly due to getting lost or
        low browsing efficiency.</p>

    <h3>3. Violation of the Universal Usability and Accessibility Principle</h3>
    <p><strong>Specific Performance:</strong> All images on the website lack alt text descriptions, so screen readers
        cannot recognize and explain the image content for visually impaired users. The contrast between text and
        background is far below the WCAG 2.1 AA standard — light gray text is used on light gray background, which is
        hard to read for users with low vision. In addition, the site does not support keyboard navigation; pressing the
        Tab key cannot focus on key buttons like "Add to Cart", so users with mobility impairments cannot finish the
        ordering process.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> Disabled users can hardly use the website at all, and mobile users also have a
        terrible browsing experience. This severely limits the website's target audience and reduces its usability.</p>

    <h3>4. Violation of the Error Prevention Principle</h3>
    <p><strong>Specific Performance:</strong> The website has a lot of broken links; clicking some product links will
        directly lead to 404 error pages. There is no success prompt after adding items to the cart, so users cannot
        confirm if their operation works. Form validation is only done after submission, and all filled-in content will
        be cleared once an error is found, forcing users to re-enter all information. Besides, there is no pre-check for
        product stock before ordering; users are only informed of out-of-stock items after they complete the payment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Impact on Users:</strong> Users have to try repeatedly to complete a single operation, which easily
        causes frustration and dissatisfaction. This results in an extremely high order abandonment rate and poor user
        retention.</p>
